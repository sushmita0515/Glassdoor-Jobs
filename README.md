# Data scientist job in Glassdoor
This repository focuses on data cleaning and transformation using Microsoft Excel, specifically tailored for data scientists in a Glassdoor role.

# Introduction
Data cleaning and transformation are critical components of a data scientist's role, as they play a fundamental role in ensuring data quality and preparing data for analysis. This repository aims to provide data scientists working in a Glassdoor role with hands-on examples and techniques specific to their needs.

The key objectives of this project are:

To demonstrate practical examples of data cleaning and transformation tasks commonly encountered by data scientists in a Glassdoor role.
To showcase Excel features, functions, and techniques that are particularly relevant for data scientists.
To foster collaboration and knowledge sharing among data scientists by encouraging contributions of additional examples and techniques.
